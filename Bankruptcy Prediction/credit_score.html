<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-preparation">Data Preparation</h2>
<p>The dataset is highly imbalanced, with a very small number of positive samples in the minority class (bankruptcy) compared to the majority class. This imbalance can lead to poor performance of machine learning models, especially when it comes to detecting the minority class. The target variable indicates whether a company will go bankrupt, with the minority class representing the instances of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>To address this issue, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is applied to generate synthetic samples for the minority class. SMOTE works by selecting a minority class sample and generating new synthetic instances by interpolating between the sample and its nearest neighbors. This technique helps balance the dataset, which can lead to improved model performance.</p>
<p>Using SMOTE has several benefits. First, it improves model accuracy by making the dataset more balanced, preventing the model from being biased toward the majority class. Second, it enhances the detection of the minority class, improving recall and F1 score for predicting bankruptcy. Third, it aids in better generalization, allowing the model to recognize unseen instances of the minority class. Lastly, SMOTE helps prevent underfitting, as an imbalanced dataset could cause the model to overlook patterns in the minority class.</p>

<li><p><strong>Balanced Accuracy</strong> is <strong>83.37%</strong>, reflecting a more balanced evaluation for imbalanced data.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Feature Importance</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Key predictors include <strong>Net income to total assets</strong>, <strong>borrowing dependency</strong>, and <strong>retained earnings to total assets</strong>, highlighting the importance of profitability, liquidity, and debt management for bankruptcy prediction.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary:</h4>
<p>The model demonstrates strong performance with high sensitivity for identifying bankrupt companies, aided by <strong>SMOTE</strong> to balance the dataset. While precision for bankruptcy is lower, this trade-off is acceptable in contexts where capturing all potential bankruptcies is crucial. Further techniques like threshold adjustment or cost-sensitive learning can help balance precision and recall. The identified financial features align with common bankruptcy risk factors.</p>

<li><p><strong>Kappa</strong>: Improved slightly to <strong>0.5227</strong>, but this small increase does not outweigh the drop in recall.</p></li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="decision-9">Decision:</h4>
<p>Given that recall (sensitivity) is critical for detecting bankruptcies, the tuned model underperforms compared to the previous model. Therefore, it is more prudent to stick with the <strong>previous model</strong>, which had better recall and balanced accuracy, ensuring better identification of the minority class (bankruptcy).</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="interpretation-of-logistic-regression-in-light-of-xgboost">Interpretation of Logistic Regression (in light of XGBoost):</h4>
<p>Logistic regression achieves a recall of <strong>75%</strong>, slightly higher than XGBoost’s <strong>72.73%</strong>, indicating it detects slightly more bankruptcy cases. This is important when prioritizing the identification of all potential bankruptcies. However, its precision is much lower at <strong>18.75%</strong> compared to XGBoost’s <strong>28.83%</strong>, leading to a higher false positive rate.</p>
<p>The overall balanced accuracy of logistic regression is <strong>82.08%</strong>, slightly lower than XGBoost’s <strong>83.37%</strong>, reflecting that XGBoost handles the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity better. Additionally, the <strong>Kappa score</strong> for logistic regression is <strong>0.2619</strong>, considerably lower than XGBoost’s <strong>0.3844</strong>, showing weaker agreement between predictions and actual labels.</p>
<p>While logistic regression is simpler and interpretable, it underperforms compared to XGBoost in terms of overall predictive power, particularly in precision and balanced accuracy. This indicates that XGBoost remains the better choice for this problem, especially when aiming for a balanced approach to detecting bankruptcies while minimizing false positives.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>26.28%</strong>, slightly lower than XGBoost’s <strong>28.83%</strong>, but higher than logistic regression’s <strong>19.69%</strong>. This indicates fewer false positives compared to logistic regression.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary-2"><strong>Summary</strong>:</h4>
<p>The ensemble model balances recall and precision effectively, achieving high sensitivity (81.82%) and balanced accuracy (87.08%). It outperforms both logistic regression and XGBoost individually in terms of recall and balanced accuracy, making it a robust choice for bankruptcy prediction. This approach ensures the minority class (bankruptcy) is well-detected while minimizing false positives compared to logistic regression.</p>
