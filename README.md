## **Projects**

### **1. Patient Length of Stay Prediction**

#### **Problem Statement:**
The project focuses on predicting the length of stay (LOS) of patients in hospitals, a critical metric for efficient healthcare management. Accurate LOS predictions aid in resource allocation, infection risk management, and improving patient care.

#### **Details:**
- **Dataset:** Patient and hospital-related data, with LOS categorized into 11 classes.
- **Goal:** Predict the LOS for each patient based on admission data.

#### **Approach:**
1. Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA) to identify patterns and relationships in the dataset.
2. Applied data preprocessing and feature engineering to improve model performance.
3. Implemented multiple machine learning models, including:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
4. Evaluated predictions using metrics like accuracy and precision.

#### **Libraries Used:**
- **Data Manipulation:** pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
